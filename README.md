# Phantom

Phantom is a minimal CMS destined to easily write, store and retrieve content from anywhere.

It is currently under active development.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) and [mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) installed.


## Installation and usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `settings.json` file based from `settings.example.json` and fill with as you wish. 
Note: the folder where you upload must be in public if you wanna see the image in the front. The `relativePath` variable is the path from the public folder to your upload folder.
3. Run `meteor --settings settings.json`

## Troubleshouting

If installation instructions don't work, try doing this as root.
